# jsonWrangling
Load, wrangle, and process JSON data files from World Bank Projects
***
Using pandas, I practiced cleaning and exploring JSON data on country submitted projects to the World Bank. The techniques used indclude:
-Loaded JSON data files
-Normalized JSON data within dataframe cells to create tabular data for further processing
-Filled missing project theme names with surrounding rows that contained the same code
  -utilizing sort, forward fill, and backward fill methods
-Explored and summarized top country proposals and themes
